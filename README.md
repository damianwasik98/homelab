# homelab
My own self-hosted developer playground where I learn new things.

In this repo I store configuration of my Kubernetes cluster hosted in my home network.

## Architecture
I started small. For now it is single node k3s cluster, but I have plans to add another nodes in the future when my needs expand. 

## Deployment
I deploy apps with GitOps approach using [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/).

## Hardware
Instead of buying new ones I decided to use my old MacBook and I installed Ubuntu on it.

MacBook Pro 13-inch, 2016, 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD
